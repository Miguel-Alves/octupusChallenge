# octupusChallenge
This repository was created to develop an app that consumes an API with geographical locations and some informations about services like TV,
Broadband, landline and aditional. As it is simple, this project was created with Expo managed workflow and used contextAPI to handle state. 
It could be done using redux and react-native  or Expo bare worflow. But I choosed the other stack for simplicity. I also created a desgin for
future implementation. This was a good challenge to exercise React Native knowledges and has a lot to grow!
